# Stock Analysis Code Refactoring
  
## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to refactor our "All Stocks Analysis" code written in VBA with Excel to run more efficiently. While the initial version worked well for a dozen stocks, our customer Steve wants to expand the dataset to analyze the entire stock market over the last few years. Our original code is not ideal for such a large-scale analysis, and would likely take a long time to execute. While the output of both versions of code was the same, we utilized arrays and nested for loops in the refactored version.

## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
