# Stock Analysis Code Refactoring
  
## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to refactor our "All Stocks Analysis" code written in VBA with Excel to handle a much larger data set by running more efficiently. While the initial version worked well for a dozen stocks, our customer Steve wants to expand the dataset to analyze the entire stock market over the last few years. Our original code is not ideal for such a large-scale analysis and would likely take a long time to execute. While the output of both versions of code was the same, we utilized arrays and nested for loops in the refactored version that enabled us to complete our analysis after only one loop through all of the data.

## Results
In 2017, nearly all stocks realized positive returns ranging from +5.55% to +199.45% (DQ). Only TERP had a negative return of -7.21% in 2017. Based on DQ's performance in 2017, it is understandable that Steve's parents were eager to invest in DQ stock.

With his parents' financial interests in mind, Steve pursued additional analysis revealing that 2018 was not a good year for the stock market. Only 2 stocks had positive returns for the year: ENPH (81.92%) and RUN (83.95%). All others performed poorly for a variety of reasons outlined here:

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
